# GHA Cron Demo
Simple Example of Updating Repo with Github Actions Cron Scheduling

Last Updated: Tue Sep  6 06:14:48 UTC 2022

It's worth noting that [cron is not guaranteed to run the scheduled time](https://upptime.js.org/blog/2021/01/22/github-actions-schedule-not-working/)

This repo has a number of scheduled jobs to run at different times of the day.
Each action run will log itself on log.csv.
Once there is enough data, I will come back and create some graphs to see how consistent or inconsistent the timing is.
